# Recurrent Neural Network (Stock Price Prediction)
# •	Built an RNN model to forecast Google stock prices using time-series data.
# •	Performed data collection, preprocessing, and scaling for optimal model input.
# •	Trained the RNN model using LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies in stock price trends
